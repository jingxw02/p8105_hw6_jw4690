The distribution of R-squared appears smooth and symmetric, resembling a
bell-shaped curve. The majority of the density is concentrated between
approximately 0.88 and 0.94. The dashed vertical lines represent the 95%
confidence interval, ranging from 0.894 to 0.927. This indicates that
the model consistently explains a large proportion of the variance in
tmax, with minimal variability in explanatory power. The density plot
confirms a lack of significant skewness, suggesting that the explanatory
power of tmin is generally stable across bootstrap samples.

``` r
# Plot distribution of log(beta_0 * beta_1)

ggplot(log_beta_product, aes(x = log_product)) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = conf_intervals_log_product$log_product_lower, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = conf_intervals_log_product$log_product_upper, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    title = "Density of log(β_0 * β_1)",
    x = expression(log(beta[0] * beta[1])),
    y = "Density"
  )
```

The density distribution is smooth, nearly symmetric, and centered
around 2.00, with the majority of the density concentrated between 1.95
and 2.10. The dashed vertical lines represent the 95% confidence
interval, spanning from 1.96 to 2.06. This narrow interval indicates
that the combined effect of β_0 and β_1 is highly consistent across
bootstrap samples. The absence of noticeable skewness or outliers
further suggests stability and reliability in this distribution.

The 95% confidence interval for R-squared is \[0.894, 0.927\]. This
indicates that the model explains approximately 89.4% to 92.7% of the
variance in tmax.

The 95% confidence interval for log(β_0 \* β_1) is \[1.96, 2.06\]. This
suggests that the combined influence of the intercept and slope is
consistent, with little variability, and its logarithmic value is
reliably within this range.
